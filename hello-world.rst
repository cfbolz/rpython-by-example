Hello World
===========

This is the source code of a traditional Hello World program written in
RPython.

.. literalinclude:: code/hello_world.py

To compile it, we should first install Python (both CPython and PyPy are OK).
In addition, we need to obtain the RPython compiler from
`PyPy's repository <https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy>`_. The RPython compiler
is located at ``pypy/rpython/bin/rpython``.

Now, we can compile our first and simple hello world example by run:

.. code-block:: shell

   rpython hello_world.py

An executable named ``hello_world-c`` is generated by the compiler. When
running the executable, a "Hello, World!" message will be printed out.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./hello_world-c
   Hello, World!
