Hello, World!
-------------

This is the source code of a traditional Hello World program written in
RPython.

.. literalinclude:: code/hello_world.py

To compile it, we should first install Python (both CPython and PyPy are OK).
In addition, we need to obtain the RPython compiler from
`PyPy's repository <https://bitbucket.org/pypy/pypy>`_. The RPython compiler
is located at ``pypy/rpython/bin/rpython``.

Now, we can compile our first hello world example by running:

.. code-block:: shell

   $ rpython hello_world.py

An executable named ``hello_world-c`` is generated by the compiler. When
launching the executable, a "Hello, World!" message will be printed out.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ ./hello_world-c
   Hello, World!

Since RPython syntax is a restricted version of Python, therefore you can
use any Python interpreter to run the hello world example just like before.
In this example, we should add an entry point in the script.

.. literalinclude:: code/hello_world_python.py

Then, you can run the script as normal with Python.

.. code-block:: shell

   $ python hello_world_python.py
   Hello, World!

This implies that you can test your RPython code with any Python interpreter and
then compile to native code.
