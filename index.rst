RPython By Example
==================

RPython by Example (RPyBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate
various RPython concepts and libraries. RPyBE starts with a hello world example
and built-in types in RPython, then dives into RPython libraries, and build a
simple application at last.

Since RPython is based on the Python syntax, most concepts in RPython are
similar with Python. However, there are still some notable differences in
built-in types. We will highlight their differences, inconsistencies, and usage
suggestions in admonition boxes within the paragraphs.
