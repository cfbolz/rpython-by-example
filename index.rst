RPython by Example
==============================================

RPython by Example (RPyBE) is a collection of runnable examples that illustrate
various RPython concepts and libraries. RPyBE starts with a hello world example
and built-in types in RPython, then dives into RPython libraries, and build a
simple application at last.
